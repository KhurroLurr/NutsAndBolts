# NutsAndBolts
Assignment for CS2

This program utilized a modified version of quick sort in order to properly
sort nut and bolt objects that could only be compared by nut to bolt and vice
versa. 

The code in MatchNutsBolts.java was written by me with the code for the
nuts and bolts provided by the instructor. In order to run, simply compile
in your preferred method and be sure to uncomment the main function.

Main function was commented as part of turning in the assignment.
